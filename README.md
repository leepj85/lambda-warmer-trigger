# Lambda with Dynamo

## Link to Gateway

NOTE: current status of APIs for PUT and POSTs require the "task" properties in the body of request. GET route for all tasks works (https://httn3i8job.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/tasks)

## Issues Encountered
* Set up took a while, there's a lot of convoluted steps with AWS. I wouldn't have progressed w/o the help of classmates.
* Wasn't certain whether lambda function should handle both add & update Task records. 
* Lab instructions are too ambigious. 
* (lab33) Used Java for lambda function methods, need to research on how to pass events, as John did in demo yesterday for Javascript.
